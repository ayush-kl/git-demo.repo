# git-demo.repo
I enjoy exploring the coding world to the fullest. It all began with my initial focus on learning C++, which eventually led me to delve into competitive programming. As I furthered my journey, I discovered GitHub and learned a little about that through youtube but stopped learning more. But, in the coding week I eagerly absorbed knowledge through the resources provided by coding clubs. Reading diverse documentations and identifying errors in projects captivated my interest, ultimately drawing me towards the realm of open source.I don't know how long it would be interesting to me but  I aspire to join our coding club and hoping to contribute and learn even more.
